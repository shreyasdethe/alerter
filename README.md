# alerter  
### This is a small Google Chrome extension I made to remind me of little things periodically.

## How to use
---
* Type what you want to be reminded of, and how often  
  
    ![Popup Menu](assets/popup_ss.png)  
  
* Hit "Start"  
  
* You will be reminded via a Chrome notification  
  
    ![Notification](assets/notif_ss.png)  
  
* Make sure the "Get notifications from apps and other senders" setting is turned on in Windows System settings
